Currently installing is a real pain, so don't do it.

There is no 'make install', so you can't anyway.

If you are compiling for windows on Linux, use
the makefile src/Makefile.linWin

If you are compiling for windows on windows use
src/Makefil.win

And lastly, if you are compiling for linux on linux use:
make

I need to learn how to do cool configuring stuff.
