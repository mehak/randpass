Things that must be done:

  . Check for any grammar errors
  . Make documentation universal, instead of 
     just a file called "randpass.1". - Check the time source code
  . Write the manpage.
  . Put the GPL on the manpage.
  . Do standard configure and make configurations.
  . Cleanup the code.
  . Work on lack of randomness in windows code

Long time in coming:
  . I would like to re-write the psuedo-random number
    generator.
