randpass is a simple psuedo-random password generator.

It is my first public program, so be easy on me.

Also, in case any files don't have the GPL on top
of them, all file are released under GPLv3.

If you want to change randpass.c, just change
the linux version and copy it to the win folder.
The windows specific stuff happens in random.h
